Project 1 for making things interactive

I really wanted to use a stress ball as the input. As an engineering student, I am always looking for ways to reduce stress and that starts with recognizing when I am stressed. I created a stress clock that uses an FSR, solenoid and stepper motor to calibrate your stress within 24 hour. When you press a stress ball, the solenoid stamps a circle on play-doh  that rotates like a clock. At the end of the day you can look at what times you were stressed and work off of that.
